## 5. Business Model Analysis

### Revenue Models Across Layers

#### Layer 1: Telephony/SIP (Commodity Pricing)

**Typical Pricing:**
- **Inbound calls:** $0.0085-0.025/minute (US); $0.003-0.008/minute (India)
- **Outbound calls:** $0.01-0.03/minute (US); $0.004-0.012/minute (India)
- **DID rental:** $1-3/month per number (US); ₹50-150/month (India)
- **Setup fees:** $50-500 (often waived for volume)

**Margin Structure:**
- Wholesale termination: 5-15% gross margin
- Retail SIP trunks: 25-40% gross margin
- Value-added services (fraud, analytics): 60-75% gross margin

**Key Drivers of Profitability:**
- **Scale:** Per-minute margin is thin ($0.002-0.008); profit requires massive volume
- **Network ownership:** On-net calls (Bandwidth) avoid wholesale costs
- **BYOC attach:** Software margins (APIs, dashboards) higher than minutes
- **International routing:** Cross-border calls carry 2-3× margins

**Example Unit Economics (US SIP Trunk):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average customer: | 50,000 min/month |
| Blended rate: | $0.015/min |
| Monthly revenue: | $750 |
| COGS (termination): | $450 (60%) |
| Gross profit: | $300 (40%) |
| CAC: | $2,000 |
| Payback: | 6.7 months |
| LTV (3yr): | $10,800 |
| LTV:CAC | 5.4× |

**India Difference:**
Lower per-minute pricing ($0.004-0.008) requires 3-5× volume for comparable revenue. Indian providers compensate with:
- Bundled connectivity (Airtel, Jio) capturing network margin
- Lower CAC (inside sales vs. US field sales)
- Compliance services (DLT) as margin enhancer

#### Layer 2: Voice-AI Infrastructure (Usage + SaaS Hybrid)

**Typical Pricing:**
- **CPaaS voice APIs:**
  - $0.0125-0.04/minute (Twilio, Daily)
  - $0.008-0.02/minute (Indian players)
- **WebRTC infrastructure:**
  - $0.004-0.008/participant-minute
  - $99-499/month platform fee
- **Recording/transcription:** $0.005-0.015/minute add-on

**Margin Structure:**
- API minutes: 50-65% gross margin
- Platform/SaaS: 75-85% gross margin
- Storage/transcription: 40-50% gross margin (cloud costs)

**Unit Economics (WebRTC SaaS):**

| Metric | SMB Customer | Enterprise Customer |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Monthly minutes | 25,000 | 500,000 |
| Platform fee | $199 | $1,999 |
| Usage charges | $125 ($0.005/min) | $2,500 |
| **Total MRR** | **$324** | **$4,499** |
| Gross margin | 70% | 68% |
| CAC | $800 | $15,000 |
| Payback | 2.5 months | 3.3 months |
| LTV (3yr) | $11,664 | $161,964 |
| LTV:CAC | 14.6× | 10.8× |

**Why Margins Are Higher:**
- Developer-facing: Lower-touch sales vs. telco relationships
- Cloud-native: No physical infrastructure (vs. Layer 1 POPs/switches)
- Stickiness: API integration = high switching cost

**LiveKit/Daily Disruptor Model:**
- **OSS core** = land (free community edition)
- **Managed cloud** = expand ($99-999/month)
- **Enterprise** = harvest ($10k+/month + professional services)

#### Layer 3: Voice-AI Agents (Value-Based Pricing)

**Typical Pricing:**
- **Per-minute:** $0.15-0.40 (US); $0.05-0.15 (India)
- **Per-interaction:** $0.50-2.00 (resolution-based)
- **Subscription:** $5k-50k/month (enterprise seat-based)
- **Outcome-based:** % of cost savings vs. human agents

**Margin Structure:**
- Gross margins: 55-75% (depends on LLM costs)
- LLM inference cost: $0.03-0.08/minute (falling 30% annually)
- TTS/STT cost: $0.01-0.03/minute
- Contribution margin: 40-60% after cloud/model costs

**Unit Economics (Autonomous Agent Provider):**

| Metric | Value (US Enterprise) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Customer ACV | $240,000 |
| Implementation | $80,000 (Year 1) |
| **Total Year 1** | **$320,000** |
| Annual usage | 2M minutes |
| Blended rate | $0.12/min |
| COGS | $0.05/min (LLM+TTS+STT+hosting) |
| Gross margin | 58% |
| CAC | $60,000 |
| Payback | 3.9 months |
| LTV (5yr) | $1.2M |
| LTV:CAC | 20× |

**Why Agent Economics Beat Infrastructure:**
- **Value capture:** Customers pay for outcomes (deflected calls, faster resolution) not just infrastructure
- **Displacement pricing:** AI at $0.15/min competes with human agents at $5-8/min-customers see 95%+ cost reduction
- **Vertical moats:** BFSI/healthcare models with compliance = higher pricing power

**India Agent Economics:**

| Metric | India Enterprise |
|--------|------------------|
| ACV | ₹80 lakh ($96k) |
| Minutes/year | 5M (higher volume, lower ACV) |
| Rate | ₹4/min ($0.048) |
| COGS | ₹1.5/min (cheaper LLM via local models) |
| Gross margin | 62.5% |
| CAC | ₹12 lakh ($14.4k) |
| Payback | 1.8 months (faster vs. US) |

**Critical Difference:**
Indian customers have *lower willingness to pay* but *higher volume tolerance*. Strategy must be land-with-volume, expand-with-features.

### Margin Cascade: Why Layer 3 Captures Most Value

| Layer | Gross Margin | Why | Strategic Implication |
|-------|--------------|-----|----------------------|
| **Layer 1: SIP** | 25-40% | Commodity; wholesale costs high | Scale or vertical integration required |
| **Layer 2: Infra** | 55-70% | Developer stickiness; cloud leverage | Platform effects; land-and-expand |
| **Layer 3: Agents** | 55-75% | Outcome-based pricing; vertical moats | Highest value capture; defensibility |

**The Integrated Play:**
Owning Layer 1 → 3 end-to-end allows:
- Capturing full $0.40/minute (vs. $0.015 for SIP alone)
- Eliminating inter-layer revenue sharing
- Controlling latency end-to-end (competitive advantage)
- Cross-subsidizing Layer 1 commoditization with Layer 3 margins
