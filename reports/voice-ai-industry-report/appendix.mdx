  └─ Complex (25% of calls)
      ├─ Escalation to human
      └─ AI agent assists human (co-pilot mode)
```

**Financial Impact:**

| Metric | Before AI | After AI (Year 1) | Savings |

Fraud alert triggered (suspicious transaction)
  ↓
AI places outbound call to customer
  ↓
Natural language:
  "Hi, this is [Bank Name] calling about a suspicious transaction.
   We noticed a ₹25,000 charge at [Merchant]. Did you make this purchase?"
  ↓
Customer responds (yes/no/unclear)
  ├─ Yes → "Thank you, transaction approved."
  ├─ No → "We've blocked the transaction and your card. A new card will arrive in 3 days."
  └─ Unclear → Transfer to human agent
```
