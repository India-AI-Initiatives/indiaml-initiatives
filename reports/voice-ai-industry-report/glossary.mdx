## Glossary & Key Terms Explained

### AI Containment Rate

**Definition:** The percentage of customer calls that are **completely handled by AI** from start to finish, without needing to transfer to a human agent.

**How It Works:**

- **30-50% containment rate** (India):
  - Out of 100 customer calls, **30-50 are solved entirely by the AI bot**
  - The customer gets their answer, issue resolved, transaction completed—all by AI
  - Only 50-70 calls need to be "escalated" to a human

- **6% containment rate** (Global average):
  - Out of 100 calls, only **6 are handled completely by AI**
  - The other 94 calls still need a human agent to finish the job
  - The AI might start the conversation, but a human has to take over

**Why This Matters:**

*Cost savings:*
- If an AI agent costs $0.50 per call vs. a human at $5.00 per call
- 50% containment = saving $2.25 per call on average
- 6% containment = saving only $0.27 per call on average

*The India Advantage:*
India companies are achieving **5-8× higher success rates** with AI handling calls than the rest of the world. This means:
- More cost savings
- Faster customer service
- Less dependency on hiring thousands of human agents

**Simple Mental Model:**

Think of it like a restaurant:
- **50% containment** = Self-service kiosk successfully completes half of all orders
- **6% containment** = Kiosk only works for 6 out of 100 customers; everyone else needs a cashier

The claim is that Indian contact centers have figured out how to make the "kiosk" (AI) work much better than anywhere else in the world.
