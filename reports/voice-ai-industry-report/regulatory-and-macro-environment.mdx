## 6. Regulatory & Macro Environment

### United States Regulatory Landscape

#### STIR/SHAKEN (Call Authentication)

**What it is:**
FCC-mandated cryptographic attestation for caller ID, combating robocalls and spoofing.

**Status:**
- Full implementation deadline: June 30, 2023 (extended from 2021)
- Non-compliance = $10k-230k per violation per day
- Required for all VoIP/SIP providers

**Impact on Market:**
- ✅ Raises barriers to entry (compliance costs $200k-2M per carrier)
- ✅ Favors established players (Twilio, Bandwidth) with infrastructure
- ❌ Penalizes small resellers unable to afford attestation
- 🔄 Creates demand for attestation-as-a-service (Bandwidth leads here)

**Voice AI Implications:**
Outbound AI agents face higher scrutiny. Legitimate use cases (appointment reminders, payment alerts) now need:
- Valid business relationship attestation (full "A" level)
- CRM integration proving prior consent
- Fallback to SMS if calls blocked

#### TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act)

**What it governs:**
Automated calling, pre-recorded messages, SMS marketing.

**Key requirements:**
- Express written consent for auto-dialed calls/texts
- Do-Not-Call registry compliance
- Opt-out mechanisms in every interaction
- 9pm-8am calling restrictions

**Penalties:**
$500-1,500 per violation; class-action friendly

**Voice AI Considerations:**
- "Automated call" includes AI agents, even with LLM-generated speech
- Consent management systems (CRM flags) now table-stakes
- "Press 1 to opt out" must trigger instant suppression
- Industry push for AI-specific clarifications (pending FCC rulemaking)

#### State Privacy Laws (CCPA, CPRA, VBPA, etc.)

**Core requirements:**
- Right to know what data is collected during calls
- Right to deletion of call recordings/transcripts
- Opt-out of "sale" (includes 3rd-party analytics vendors)
- Biometric data consent for voice-printing (Illinois BIPA, Texas CUBI)

**Voice AI Exposure:**
- LLM training on customer call data = potential "sale" under CCPA
- Voice cloning/emotion detection = biometric data (requires explicit consent)
- Retention policies: Many states limit recording storage to 90 days

### India Regulatory Landscape

#### TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority)

**Key regulations affecting voice AI:**

1. **DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) for Spam:**
   - All commercial calls/SMS must be registered on blockchain
   - ₹5,000 fine per unregistered interaction
   - **Impact:** Creates compliance moat for established players (Tanla, Route Mobile); startups struggle with multi-operator integrations

2. **Interconnection charges:**
   - IUC (Interconnect Usage Charge) reduced to ₹0 in 2020
   - Shift to "bill and keep" model (sender pays network costs)
   - **Impact:** Lowers voice termination costs, accelerating VoIP adoption

3. **Numbering plan:**
   - DID allocation fragmented by 22 telecom circles
   - Virtual number providers need separate licenses per state
   - **Impact:** Slows national SIP rollout; benefits incumbents with existing allocations

#### IT Act 2000 & Aadhaar Act

**Data localization:**
- Payment data must be stored in India (RBI mandate)
- "Critical personal data" (inc. financial, health) may require localization (pending)
- **Voice AI Impact:** International SIP trunking okay, but transcripts/analytics data may need in-country hosting

**KYC for voice bots:**
- Aadhaar-based eKYC required for financial transactions
- Voice biometrics proposed as authentication method
- **Opportunity:** Unified voice-ID for banking (Uniphore, Skit pursuing)

#### DoT (Department of Telecom) Compliance

**Lawful Intercept (LI) requirements:**
- All VoIP/CPaaS providers must build interception capability
- 24/7 monitoring portal for law enforcement
- **Cost:** ₹2-5 crore capex per provider; ongoing audit costs
- **Impact:** High barrier for startups; acquired players (Airtel IQ, Jio CX) absorb into telco infrastructure

### European Union (GDPR, ePrivacy, AI Act)

#### GDPR (Voice-Specific Considerations)

**Consent for recording:**
- "Explicit, informed, freely given" consent before recording
- Cannot be bundled with T&Cs (must be separate checkbox)
- Withdrawal must be as easy as granting

**Right to erasure:**
- Customers can demand call recording deletion
- Must honor within 30 days
- LLM training data = extra complexity (can you "untrain" a model?)

**Data minimization:**
- Transcript only what's necessary
- Delete after retention purpose satisfied (e.g., 90 days for QA)

**Voice AI Implications:**
- Real-time processing (no recording) preferred to minimize liability
- Anonymization pipelines (stripping PII) before analytics
- On-prem deployments growing in EU to keep data local

#### EU AI Act (Voice-Specific Classifications)

**High-Risk Systems (includes many voice AI use cases):**
- Emotion detection in employment/education (banned in some contexts)
- Biometric categorization (accent, dialect inferencing)
- **Requirements:** Conformity assessment, human oversight, transparency

**General-Purpose AI (LLMs):**
- If >10^25 FLOPs (e.g., GPT-4 class): Systemic risk evaluation
- Voice AI using frontier models = inherits compliance burden

**Voice AI Strategy:**
- Build "human-in-loop" into high-stakes interactions (insurance claims, loan approvals)
- Transparency: Disclose when customer is talking to AI (no "passing as human")
- Document training data provenance (GDPR Article 22: automated decision-making)

### Macro-Economic Factors

#### Labor Cost Arbitrage Erosion

**The Problem:**
- US contact center agent: $15-25/hour → $3,750-6,250/month loaded
- India contact center agent: $3-6/hour → $750-1,500/month loaded
- **Historic arbitrage:** 75-80% savings drove offshoring

**The Shift:**
- AI agent: $0.15-0.40/minute → $1,800-4,800/month for 24/7 coverage (10k min/month)
- **New arbitrage:** 70-90% savings vs. India labor

**Implication:**
India's BPO advantage compressed from 75% to 25-50% vs. AI. Voice AI adoption in India is *faster* than US because wage delta no longer justifies human-only model.

#### Cloud Infrastructure Pricing

**Trend:**
- Compute costs (GPU inference): -30%/year (NVIDIA volume, competition)
- Network egress: -15%/year (AWS/GCP pricing pressure)
- Storage: Effectively $0 marginal cost now

**Impact on Voice AI:**
- 2022: LLM inference = $0.20/minute → made AI uneconomical
- 2025: $0.03-0.05/minute → AI now cheaper than human
- 2027 (projected): $0.01-0.02/minute → AI 100× cheaper than human

**Strategic Implication:**
Business models based on "AI as cost center" flip to "human agents as luxury." Pricing power shifts to whoever controls *quality* (vertical models, compliance) not infrastructure.

#### 5G & Edge Computing

**Opportunity:**
- 5G network slicing: Guaranteed &lt;50ms latency for voice packets
- Edge POPs: Process STT/TTS locally (reduce cloud round-trip)

**India Advantage:**
- Jio/Airtel 5G rollout fastest globally (400M+ subscribers by 2025)
- Network-adjacent AI inference (Airtel IQ, Jio CX) = structural latency advantage

**Challenge:**
- Edge deployment requires CapEx (POPs in 50+ cities)
- ROI unclear until 5G SA (standalone) core deployed
