## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Customer Segments

**Primary:**
- **Mid-Market (100-1000 employees):** Large enough to have significant call volume, but lack the internal engineering resources to build a custom voice AI stack. They are motivated by ROI and efficiency gains.
- **Enterprises (>1000 employees):** High call volume and budget for digital transformation. They require robust security, compliance, and scalability. Sales cycles are longer, but deal sizes are larger.

**Secondary:**
- **Startups (High-growth, tech-enabled):** Early adopters who need to scale customer support without a linear increase in headcount. They value developer experience and speed of integration.

### Sales & Distribution Channels

- **Direct Sales (Enterprise & Mid-Market):** Account executives focused on building relationships and demonstrating ROI.
- **Partner Channel (Mid-Market & SMB):** Resellers, system integrators, and consultants who can bundle the voice AI platform with their existing services.
- **Self-Service (SMB & Developers):** A product-led growth (PLG) motion with a free tier and transparent pricing to encourage adoption and experimentation.
