| Company | Ticker | Market Cap | 2025E Revenue | EV/Revenue | Gross Margin | Revenue Growth (YoY) |
|---------|--------|------------|---------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Twilio** | TWLO | $12.8B | $4.8B | 2.7× | 48% | 8% (slowing) |
| **RingCentral** | RNG | $3.2B | $2.4B | 1.3× | 72% | 6% |

- **CPaaS infrastructure (Twilio, Bandwidth):** 1.3-2.7×, treated as commodity
- **Gross margin** differentiates: 70%+ = software, &lt;50% = telco-like

**Private Comparables (Last Known Valuations)**

| Company | Last Funding | Valuation | Revenue (est.) | Revenue Multiple | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| **Replicant** | Series B (2023) | $700M | $30M ARR (est.) | 23× | Premium for AI-native, &lt;1s latency |
| **PolyAI** | Series C (2024) | $500M | $20M ARR (est.) | 25× | 40-language model commands premium |
| **Uniphore** | Series E (2023) | $2.5B | $500M | 5× | India-based; lower multiple reflects emerging market discount |
| **LiveKit** | Series B (2024) | $300M | $10M ARR (est.) | 30× | OSS + enterprise; developer love premium |
| **Daily** | Growth (2023) | $200M (implied) | $6M ARR | 33× | Real-time infra scarcity value |

**Valuation Drivers for Voice AI:**
1. **Latency (&lt;1s):** 2-3× premium vs. >2s solutions
2. **Verticalization:** BFSI/healthcare models command 1.5-2× generic
3. **Gross margin:** >65% targets 20-30× ARR; &lt;55% targets 5-10×
4. **Developer NPS:** OSS-led or top developer satisfaction = 20-40% premium

### Unit Economics: Best-in-Class Targets

#### Layer 1: SIP/Telephony

| Metric | Median | Top Quartile | Best-in-Class (Bandwidth) |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Gross Margin | 35% | 42% | 48% |
| CAC Payback | 8 months | 5 months | 3.2 months |
| Net Revenue Retention | 95% | 105% | 112% |
| Sales Efficiency (GTM/ARR) | 1.2 | 0.85 | 0.62 |

**What Top Quartile Does Differently:**
- BYOC enterprise contracts (multi-year, predictable)
- Value-added services attach (fraud detection, analytics)
- Usage growth from existing customers (NRR >100%)

#### Layer 2: CPaaS Infrastructure

| Metric | Median | Top Quartile | Best-in-Class (LiveKit) |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Gross Margin | 62% | 72% | 78% |
| CAC Payback | 6 months | 3 months | 2.1 months (OSS land) |
| LTV:CAC | 6× | 12× | 18× |
| Logo Retention | 88% | 93% | 96% |

**What Top Quartile Does Differently:**
- Developer-led growth (OSS, free tier, viral loops)
- Expansion revenue (usage scales with customer growth)
- Low-touch sales (PLG motion)

#### Layer 3: Voice AI Agents

| Metric | Median | Top Quartile | Best-in-Class (Replicant) |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Gross Margin | 60% | 70% | 74% |
| CAC Payback | 9 months | 5 months | 3.8 months |
| LTV:CAC | 12× | 20× | 28× |
| Dollar-Based NRR | 110% | 135% | 158% |

**What Top Quartile Does Differently:**
- Land-and-expand: Start with 1-2 use cases, grow to 10+
- Outcome pricing: Share in savings vs. fixed per-minute
- Vertical depth: Pre-built compliance playbooks (BFSI, healthcare)

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by Segment

| Customer Segment | Avg Deal Size (ACV) | Typical CAC | CAC/ACV Ratio | Payback (Months) |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **SMB (&lt;100 seats)** | $12k | $2.4k | 20% | 2.4 |
| **Mid-Market (100-1000 seats)** | $120k | $18k | 15% | 1.8 |
| **Enterprise (>1000 seats)** | $600k | $90k | 15% | 1.8 |

**India Adjustments:**
- Deal sizes: 40-60% of US equivalent (purchasing power)
- CAC: 30-50% of US (lower sales costs, inside sales model)
- Payback: Faster in India (1-2 months typical for mid-market)

### Churn & Retention Benchmarks

#### Logo Churn (Annual)

| Company Type | SMB | Mid-Market | Enterprise |
|--------------|-----|------------|------------|
| SIP/Telephony | 18-25% | 8-12% | 3-6% |
| CPaaS Infra | 15-22% | 6-10% | 2-5% |
| Voice AI Agents | 12-18% | 5-8% | 2-4% |

**Why Voice AI has lower churn:**
- Switching cost: Retraining models, re-integrating tools
- Vertical moats: Compliance playbooks hard to replicate
- Usage growth: AI handles more interactions over time (NRR >100%)

#### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Cohort-based NRR (Month 12):**
- **Top Quartile Voice AI:** 130-160%
- **Median Voice AI:** 105-120%
- **Bottom Quartile:** 85-100%

**What drives >130% NRR:**
- **Expansion triggers:**
  - Add new use cases (start with order status → add payment IVR)
  - Geographic rollout (start US → expand India, LatAm)
  - Increase automation % (20% → 40% of calls)
- **Pricing levers:**
  - Volume tiers (unlock discounts at 5M min/month)
  - Success fees (% of agent hours saved)
  - Platform fees (per-user licensing for agent copilots)

### Profitability Milestones

#### Path to EBITDA Positive (Typical Timeline)

| Metric | Seed/Series A | Series B | Series C+ |
|--------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| ARR | &lt;$5M | $15-30M | $50M+ |
| Gross Margin | 50-60% | 60-70% | 65-75% |
| Sales & Marketing (% rev) | 80-120% | 50-70% | 35-50% |
| R&D (% rev) | 40-60% | 30-40% | 20-30% |
| G&A (% rev) | 25-35% | 15-20% | 10-15% |
| **EBITDA Margin** | **-80% to -100%** | **-20% to -40%** | **0% to +15%** |

**India Difference:**
Indian companies reach EBITDA-positive earlier:
- **Exotel:** EBITDA+ in H2 FY24 at $54M revenue
- **Route Mobile:** Profitable at ₹4,023 Cr ($484M)

**Why:** Lower burn on S&M (inside sales), R&D (cheaper engineering), and G&A (less equity comp).

### Rule of 40

**Definition:** Growth Rate (%) + EBITDA Margin (%) ≥ 40%

| Company Tier | Growth | EBITDA Margin | Rule of 40 Score | Valuation Impact |
|--------------|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Hyper-growth (Replicant, LiveKit)** | 100-150% | -40% | 60-110 | Premium (20-30× ARR) |
| **Efficient growth (Bandwidth)** | 15% | 28% | 43 | Fair value (3-5× ARR) |
| **Cash-gen (Twilio)** | 8% | 18% | 26 | Discount (2-3× ARR) |

**Voice AI Sweet Spot:**
- Early (pre-$30M ARR): Prioritize growth (80-100%+), EBITDA -50%
- Scale ($30-100M ARR): Balance (40-60% growth, EBITDA -10% to +5%)
- Mature (>$100M ARR): Efficiency (20-30% growth, EBITDA +15-25%)
