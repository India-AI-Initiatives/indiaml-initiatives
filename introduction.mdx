# Introduction

India AI Initiatives is a community-led effort to accelerate practical progress in foundational AI by building, sharing, and applying open resources.

## Mission

- **Core thought:** Try something real in foundational AI models—keep it 100% open (MIT) so anyone can use, learn from, and build on it.
- **Outcomes:** Hands-on projects, openly licensed models and tools, and a high-signal repository of resources for the community.

## Who This Is For

- **Researchers:** DL/ML/AI research and experimentation
- **AI Product & Program:** PMs shaping model and product directions
- **Engineers & Infra:** Inference, systems, GPU, and platform engineering
- **AI Entrepreneurs:** Building AI-native products and companies
- **Resources Enablers:** Grants, infra, and collaboration partners

## Community Guidelines

- Focus on core, high-signal discussions and resources that help people make progress.
- Share learning directly; avoid posting links only for traffic routing.
- If you have deeper material (blog posts, code repos, model repos, videos, podcasts), share them with concise context on what it adds.

## What You’ll Find Here

This documentation organizes resources into focused sections. Each section will grow as we add more material:

- **Initiatives:** Overview and starting point (`introduction`)
- **Models:** Model landscape and areas like LLMs, foundational AI, infra, voice/video, gaming, space, robotics, and enterprise AI (`models/*`)
- **Papers:** Curated papers by topic, including LLMs, foundational AI, voice/video, gaming, space, robotics, and enterprise AI (`papers/*`)
- **Startups:** Notable Indian AI startups by category (`startups/*`)
- **Ideas:** Seed ideas and prompts for projects across domains (`ideas/*`)
- **Readings:** Papers, reports, books, and other helpful readings (`readings/*`)
- **Podcasts:** Curated podcast episodes by theme (`podcasts/*`)
- **Grants:** Government, non-profit, and global grant opportunities (`grants/*`)
- **Investors:** Angels, VCs, and global investors relevant to AI (`investors/*`)
- **Jobs:** Role listings across deeptech, foundational, infra, space, robotics, voice/video, gaming, and enterprise AI (`jobs/*`)
